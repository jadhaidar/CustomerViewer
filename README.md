# Customer Viewer

A simple GUI to view, search and sort customer data from a formatted .csv file. Can be used to convert data into a well organized directory of HTML pages to further enhance the viewing experience. 

This was my first ever graphical user interface that had a practical use. Initially starting out as an assignment for a Computer Science class, it quickly grew into a pet project I obsessed over for a while. 

## Getting Started

Your data must be formatted using the following format:

```
FirstName, LastName, Company, Address, City, County, State, ZIP, Phone, Fax, Email, Web
```

## Features

* Search and sort by any field
* Export to HTML directory for better viewing
